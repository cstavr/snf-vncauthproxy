snf-vncauthproxy
================

snf-vncauthproxy is a daemon, which acts as a VNC authentication proxy between
a VNC client and server.

snf-vncauthproxy's daemon listens on a TCP socket for control messages and sets
up one-time port forwardings upon request.

Main features include:
  * Lightweight, coroutine-based main loop with gevent
  * Supports RFB protocol version 3.8
  * IPv4 and IPv6 support
  * Configurable timeout for client connections

Its main use is to enable VNC clients to connect to firwalled VNC servers.

It is used by Synnefo (snf-cyclades-app) to provide users with (VNC) console
access to their VMs.
